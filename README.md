# adventofcode
My attempt at advent of code. Ideally using one programming language from each
paradigm. Code is rough, doesn't adhere to a stringent specification, or use a
build system. It's simply the code I used to get the answers I wanted. Sometimes
(most of the time) it's inelegant. If I have time after Christmas I'll look
on ways to improve (I probably won't).
